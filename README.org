* Reconstruction [rec]
** extraction of TRD digits from a raw file
   rec/rec_digits.C

   Reads a raw data file and extracts the TRD digits into a file
   TRD.Digits.root. Can be used to re-run the MCM emulator and for
   detailed PID and other studies.


** full reconstruction
   rec/rec.C

   This runs the full reconstruction. This script was taken from
   alien:///alice/cern.ch/user/a/alidaq/LHC13f/rec.C. The only
   modification is that TRD digits should be recorded as well.
